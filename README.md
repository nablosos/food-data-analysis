# 🧑‍💻 The FoodStyles Technical Challenge

## ⭐ Executive Summary

This challenge tested my abilities in applying my knowledge and skills. Provided with a dataset on restaurants in Europe, I had to conduct some analysis in a span of about one day in four important areas:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Understanding
3. Business-Specific Analysis
4. Optimization

The challenge tested my abilities in data manipulation and cleaning techniques, inferential and descriptive statistics, business intelligence a bit of data visualization, and data storytelling and communication. This repository contains my work.
